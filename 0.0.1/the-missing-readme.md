Inertia, the characteristic that we’ve added to Ousterhout’s list, is software’s
tendency to stay in use. Easily discarded code used for a quick experiment has
low inertia. A service that powers a dozen business-critical applications has high
inertia. Complexity’s cost accrues over time, so high-inertia, high-change
systems should be simplified, while low-inertia or low-change systems can be
left complex (as long as you discard them or continue to leave them alone).
