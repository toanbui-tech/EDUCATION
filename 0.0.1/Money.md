 # Type 1: Why do software engineering jobs pay so poorly?
 As I read this question, I am sort of shaking my head. I guess the world is finally evolving in about the way I predicted it eventually would.

 When I graduated from engineering school in 1980, computer jobs paid very well. Especially if you were good at what you did. And during the long period of booming Silicon Valley expansion, it was almost always the case that hardware and software engineers were very well paid.

 I left the industry in 2011 and I am very happy to enjoy retirement. I sort of predicted that software engineering would start to segregate itself into a relatively few people doing highly paid, very creative work, and a much larger set of people doing easier jobs and getting paid less.
